# Aim: 
Apache Spark, a parallel processing framework with in-memory capabilities, significantly enhances the performance of big data analytics. Azure Synapse Analytics provides a cloud-based implementation of Spark through serverless Spark pools, which are easy to configure and scale. These pools integrate seamlessly with Azure Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2 for efficient data processing. In this project, we will design a data pipeline using Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Storage, Synapse Spark Pools, and Power BI to transform an airline dataset, store the processed data in Spark tables, and visualize the results in Power BI.

# Tech Stack:
Language: SQL, Python
# Framework: Spark
Services: Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Storage, Azure Synapse Spark Pool, Power BI
